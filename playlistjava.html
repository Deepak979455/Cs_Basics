            <h3>What is JAVA?</h3>
            <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in the mid-1990s. <br>It was designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.</p>
<br>
<h1>Here are some key points about Java:</h1>
<br>
<h1>Object-Oriented: </h1><br><p>Java is based on the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. It emphasizes the concept of objects, which encapsulate data and behaviors together. Object-oriented programming provides concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.</p>
<br>
<h1>Platform-Independent: </h1><br><p>Java programs are compiled into an intermediate representation called bytecode, which can be executed by a JVM. This allows Java programs to be run on any system with a compatible JVM, making Java platform-independent.</p>
<br>
<h1>Robust and Secure: </h1><br><p>Java was designed with a strong emphasis on reliability, robustness, and security. It includes features like automatic memory management (garbage collection), exception handling, and built-in security mechanisms to prevent malicious code execution.</p>
<br>
<h1>Syntax and Structure: </h1><br><p>Java has a C/C++-inspired syntax, making it relatively easy for programmers familiar with those languages to learn Java. Java code is organized into classes, and each class contains methods, variables, and other members.
</p><br>
<h1>Standard Library:</h1> <br><p>Java comes with a vast standard library, known as the Java Class Library or the Java API (Application Programming Interface). It provides a wide range of pre-built classes and methods for common tasks, such as file I/O, networking, database connectivity, GUI development, and more.</p>
<br>
<h1>Application Domains: </h1><br><p>Java is widely used in various domains, including web development, mobile app development (Android), enterprise software development, scientific computing, game development, and more.</p>
<br>
<h1>Multi-threading:</h1><br> <p>Java has built-in support for multi-threading, allowing developers to create concurrent and parallel programs. This enables efficient utilization of system resources and enables the development of responsive and scalable applications.
</p><br>
<h1>Community and Ecosystem: </h1><br><p>Java has a large and active community of developers, which has contributed to a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries, frameworks, and tools. This ecosystem provides developers with a wide range of options for building Java applications efficiently.
<br>
Java is a versatile and widely adopted programming language, known for its robustness, portability, and scalability. It is used by millions of developers worldwide and powers numerous applications, from small-scale projects to large enterprise systems.</p>
